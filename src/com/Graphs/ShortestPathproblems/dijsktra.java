/*Given a weighted, undirected and connected graph of V vertices and an adjacency
list adj where adj[i] is a list of lists containing two integers where the first integer
of each list j denotes there is edge between i and j , second integers corresponds to the
 weight of that  edge . You are given the source vertex S and You to Find the shortest
  distance of all the vertex's from the source vertex S. You have to return a list of
  integers denoting shortest
distance between each node and Source vertex S.

        Note: The Graph doesn't contain any negative weight cycle.

        Example 1:

        Input:
        V = 2
        adj [] = {{{1, 9}}, {{0, 9}}}
        S = 0
        Output:
        0 9
        Explanation:

        The source vertex is 0. Hence, the shortest
        distance of node 0 is 0 and the shortest
        distance from node 1 is 9.


        Example 2:

        Input:
        V = 3, E = 3
        adj = { {{1, 1}, {2, 6}}, {{2, 3}, {0, 1}}, {{1, 3}, {0, 6}}}
        S = 2
        Output:
        4 3 0
        Explanation:

        For nodes 2 to 0, we can follow the path-
        2-1-0. This has a distance of 1+3 = 4,
        whereas the path 2-0 has a distance of 6. So,
        the Shortest path from 2 to 0 is 4.
        The shortest distance from 0 to 1 is 1 .*/
